Project Title & Overview :

Title: Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning (CNN)
One-liner: "A deep learning-based system to detect brain tumors from MRI scans."
Short explanation of importance: early detection, healthcare impact, etc.


Problem Statement :
Brain tumors are life-threatening and early detection is critical. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and error-prone.


Proposed Solution :
Built a CNN model for multi-class classification (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor).
Achieved high accuracy with MRI dataset.
Added Grad-CAM for model explainability.


Dataset: 
Used Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset from Kaggle.

Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Streamlit (for web app), Grad-CAM.


Usage:
Upload MRI scan.
Model predicts tumor type.
Visual explanation using Grad-CAM heatmaps.


Results:
Training Accuracy: ~XX%
Validation Accuracy: ~XX%
Confusion Matrix + Example Predictions (add images/screenshots).


Future Work:
Improve dataset size.
Use transfer learning (ResNet, EfficientNet).
